			<h2>Hi! I'm Alexis. &#128075;&#127997;</h2>
			<p>I'm an interdisciplinary, front-end focused developer who prides herself in compassion. At the core of everything I do is a desire to help others, demonstrated by a background in teaching and tutoring computer science students, doing outreach work for youth in STEM, and sharing my techspertise with non-profit organizations. As a developer, I want to manifest that drive into projects that bring real, profound good to people's lives.</p>
