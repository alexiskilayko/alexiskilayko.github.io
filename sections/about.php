					<p >I'm a Filipino American (she/her) born and based in New York City. I'm currently in my final year at Smith College, where I'm pursuing a B.A. in Computer Science.</p>
					<p>I had my informal start with coding in third grade, when I loved to play around in HTML and CSS on online video game forums. (I was very cool. And probably too young.) Fast forward to sophomore year of college, I took my first computer science course, instantly felt a click, and declared my major soon after. And now I'm here!</p>
					<p>Aside from being a programmer, I'm a self-taught <a href="https://www.instagram.com/seijizero/" target="_blank">drummer</a>, amateur <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzWdcBzXPwBoH_dUac6eMOQ" target="_blank">dancer</a>, obsessive <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/alexo.patronum?si=HxHcYAtXSNyrNnxMMGFlLQ" target="_blank">playlist maker</a>, and lifelong video game lover. Check out what games I'm playing!</p>
